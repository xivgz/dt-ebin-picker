Face numbers
Au Ra is easy to sort by face type
The only other race sorted by face number is male Miqo'te because I can easily tell the difference 

EYE COLOUR
blw - Black, white, grey
bp - Blue to purple
gt - Green to teal
oyb - Orange, yellow, brown
rp - Red to pink
If I can't tell the color of the eyes from the picture I cropped, I'll usually leave it out especially if the character is easy to tell apart from others
Same with heterochromia
