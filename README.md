# FAQ:
\>What is an ebin?\
Ebic epin ebin posti \:DDD\
\
\>Why am I here?\
Post your character less.\
\
\>Why am I not in this list?\
Post your character more.\
\
\>You choose bad pictures! Update my picture!\
Post better screenshots.\
\
\>There are multiple of the same person!\
If someone posts as an alt or golem constantly, I will keep it in because it's too bothersome to sort out.\
I will try to limit the alts and golems per subrace and gender at least.\
However, one-off golems like glamourer changes to ebicly reply to anchorposts shouldn't be included.\
\
\>How do I check if I made the list?\
You can check in the folders. They're sorted by race, gender, and eye color. Some races are sorted into face numbers or subraces.\
Alternatively, you can set the min batch size to a number higher than the remaining counter to look at all characters on one page.\
\
\>Remove me from the list!\
You shouldn't have posted your character.
